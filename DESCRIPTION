Description: Implementation of the Johnson Quantile-Parameterised Distribution in R. 
  The Johnson Quantile-Parameterised Distribution (J-QPD) is a flexible distribution
  system that is parameterised by a symmetric percentile triplet of quantile values
  (typically the 10th-50th-90th) along with known support bounds for the distribution.
  The J-QPD system was developed by Hadlock and Bickel (2017) <doi:deca.2016.0343>.
  This package implements the density, quantile, CDF and random number generator functions.
